#### What is Regression
Regression means the power or tendency that tries to go to the mean of given dataset. Linear regression find a line that represent the data set.

#### What is Linear Regression
Linear Regression divide given data set in half

#### Key Vocabs
- Weights: Weight is a variable that affects next training and gives more weights for certain judgement of AI. 
- Bias: It can be considered as default value that helps to judge given data set.
- Cost: Difference between real values and values made by hypothesis(aka Model).

### Hypothesis & Cost of Linear Regression

#### Cost

### Goal
By getting cost we can tell how hypothesis is close to the data set. 
By getting the lowest cost we can get the closest hypothesis values.
Thus, we can find a right `W(weight) and b(bias)` that represents the data set the most.
